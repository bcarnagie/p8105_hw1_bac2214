# Problem 1 
This **code chunk** loads the data set:

```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```

This code chunk creates values for the questions asked in problem 1: 
```{r}
num_rows = nrow(early_january_weather)
num_col = ncol(early_january_weather)

variable_contents = ls(early_january_weather)

print(variable_contents)

mean_temperature = mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

After running this code chunk, I see that the ""early_january_weather" contains **`r num_col`** columns and **`r num_rows`** rows. The dataset contains basic informations in regards to weather for the first `r max(early_january_weather$day)` days in January including but not limited to the humidity, temperature, and wind speed every hour.

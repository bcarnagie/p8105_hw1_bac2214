# Problem 1

This code chunk loads the data set:

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

This code chunk creates values for the questions asked in problem 1:

``` r
num_rows = nrow(early_january_weather)
num_col = ncol(early_january_weather)

variable_contents = ls(early_january_weather)

print(variable_contents)
```

    ##  [1] "day"        "dewp"       "hour"       "humid"      "month"     
    ##  [6] "origin"     "precip"     "pressure"   "temp"       "time_hour" 
    ## [11] "visib"      "wind_dir"   "wind_gust"  "wind_speed" "year"

``` r
mean_temperature = mean(early_january_weather$temp)
mean_temperature_rounded = round(mean_temperature, digits = 2)
```

After running this code chunk, I see that the dataset contains **15**
columns and **358** rows. The dataset contains basic information in
regards to weather for the first 15 days in January including but not
limited to the humidity, temperature, and wind speed every hour.
According to this dataset, the first 15 days in January had an average
temperature of 39.58 degrees Fahrenheit.

This code chunk will create the scatterplot.

``` r
question1_plot = ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()

print(question1_plot)
```

This code exports the project directory to my project directory.

``` r
ggsave("question1_plot.png", plot = question1_plot)
```

The plot seems to zig zag up and down from left to right (which I expect
correlates to a higher temperature during the daylight and a lower
temperature during the night time), but I notice a gradual increase in
temperature as the month of January progresses.The lowest temperature is
just below 25 degrees while the highest temperature is slightly above 55
degrees.

# Problem 2

This code chunk creates the dataframe:

``` r
hw_df = tibble(
  rsamp = rnorm(10),
  log_vec = rsamp > 0,
  char_vec = c("apple", "banana", "cherry", "watermelon", "pineapple", "grape", "kiwi", "blueberry", "mango", "orange"),
  factor_vec = factor(
    rep(c("level_1", "level_2", "level_3"), length.out = 10),
    levels = c("level_1", "level_2", "level_3")
))

hw_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 Ã— 4
    ##       rsamp log_vec char_vec   factor_vec
    ##       <dbl> <lgl>   <chr>      <fct>     
    ##  1  0.00727 TRUE    apple      level_1   
    ##  2  0.524   TRUE    banana     level_2   
    ##  3 -0.299   FALSE   cherry     level_3   
    ##  4  0.00796 TRUE    watermelon level_1   
    ##  5  0.572   TRUE    pineapple  level_2   
    ##  6  0.145   TRUE    grape      level_3   
    ##  7 -0.789   FALSE   kiwi       level_1   
    ##  8 -0.0124  FALSE   blueberry  level_2   
    ##  9  1.53    TRUE    mango      level_3   
    ## 10 -0.387   FALSE   orange     level_1

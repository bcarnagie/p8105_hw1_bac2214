``` r

```

# Problem 1

This **code chunk** loads the data set:

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

This code chunk creates values for the questions asked in problem 1:

``` r
num_rows = nrow(early_january_weather)
num_col = ncol(early_january_weather)

variable_contents = ls(early_january_weather)

print(variable_contents)
```

    ##  [1] "day"        "dewp"       "hour"       "humid"      "month"     
    ##  [6] "origin"     "precip"     "pressure"   "temp"       "time_hour" 
    ## [11] "visib"      "wind_dir"   "wind_gust"  "wind_speed" "year"

``` r
mean_temperature = mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

After running this code chunk, I see that the ““early_january_weather”
contains **15** columns and **358** rows. The dataset contains basic
informations in regards to weather for the first 15 days in January
including but not limited to the humidity, temperature, and wind speed
every hour.

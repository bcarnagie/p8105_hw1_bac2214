# Problem 1

This code chunk loads the data set:

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

This code chunk creates values for the questions asked in problem 1:

``` r
num_rows = nrow(early_january_weather)
num_col = ncol(early_january_weather)

variable_contents = ls(early_january_weather)

print(variable_contents)
```

    ##  [1] "day"        "dewp"       "hour"       "humid"      "month"     
    ##  [6] "origin"     "precip"     "pressure"   "temp"       "time_hour" 
    ## [11] "visib"      "wind_dir"   "wind_gust"  "wind_speed" "year"

``` r
mean_temperature = mean(early_january_weather$temp)
mean_temperature_rounded = round(mean_temperature, digits = 2)
```

After running this code chunk, I see that the dataset contains **15**
columns and **358** rows. The dataset contains basic information in
regards to weather for the first 15 days in January including but not
limited to the humidity, temperature, and wind speed every hour.
According to this dataset, the first 15 days in January had an average
temperature of 39.58 degrees Fahrenheit.

This code chunk will create the scatterplot.

``` r
question1_plot = ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()

print(question1_plot)
```

``` r
# Exports the project directory to my project directory.
ggsave("question1_plot.png", plot = question1_plot)
```

The plot seems to zig zag up and down from left to right (which I expect
correlates to a higher temperature during the daylight and a lower
temperature during the night time), but I notice a gradual increase in
temperature as the month of January progresses.The lowest temperature is
just below 25 degrees while the highest temperature is slightly above 55
degrees.

# Problem 2

This code chunk creates the data frame:

``` r
hw_df <- tibble(
  rsamp = rnorm(10),
  log_vec = rsamp > 0,
  char_vec = c("apple", "banana", "cherry", "watermelon", "pineapple", "grape", "kiwi", "blueberry", "mango", "orange"),
  factor_vec = factor(
    rep(c("mild", "medium", "spicy"), length.out = 10),
    levels = c("mild", "medium", "spicy")
  )
)
# Taking the means of each vector
mean_rsamp <- hw_df %>% pull(rsamp) %>% mean()
mean_log_vec <- hw_df %>% pull(log_vec) %>% mean()
mean_char_vec <- hw_df %>% pull(char_vec) %>% mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_factor_vec <- hw_df %>% pull(factor_vec) %>% mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

When pulling the means for the 4 different types of variables in
`hw_df`, I was able to get a mean of 0.7 for the random samples and 0.8
for the logical vector. However, I got a warning message when trying to
take the mean of the character vector and factor vector (as you can see
above).  

This code chunk applies `as.numeric` to the logical, character, and
factor variables.

``` r
log_to_num = as.numeric(hw_df %>% pull(log_vec))
char_to_num = as.numeric(hw_df %>% pull(char_vec))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
factor_to_num = as.numeric(hw_df %>% pull(factor_vec))
```

- For the logical vectors, `TRUE` are coded as 1 and `FALSE` are coded
  as 0.
  - This makes sense why I am able to get a mean for the logical vector.
- For the character vectors, all off the values are `NA` since the
  characters are not numeric.
  - This makes sense why I get a warning message while trying to
    calculate the mean.
- For the factor vector, the factor levels are converted to the number
  associated with their level, but it may not have a meaningful
  interpretation (especially if the factors are nominal).
  - This makes sense why I get a warning message while trying to
    calculate the mean.
